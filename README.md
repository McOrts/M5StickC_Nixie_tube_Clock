# Nixie tube clock simulated on ESP32 using the device M5Stick-C
To build a Nixie tube clock is a perpetual project on my mind. But they require high voltage, expensive and not easy to be wereable. So the feeling I wanted to see was made by software.

The perfect opportunity came up to me when I get the M5Stich-C. It is an amazing device based on ESP32 with a small LCD display of 80 Ã— 160 pixel, but bright and clear.
